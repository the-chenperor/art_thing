<!--     This mindblowingly realistic image of a tiger was created by traditional artist Paul Lung. The Hong Kong-based creative's portfolio on Deviant Art is astonishing, featuring realistic portraits of both humans and animals. The time in which each takes depends on his subject matter, with one cat sketch taking Lung approximately 60 hours to complete. Lung is a business design consultant,
and a pencil artist. (To be paraphrased.)

<!--     Give self-taught artist Jay Varma a coloured pencil and a piece of paper and it will undoubtedly result in a gorgeous illustration, like this one titled Mother. Art runs throughout Varma's family, his grandfather being master oil painter Raja Ravi Varma - one of the most highly regarded artists in India. Varma's skills have been recognised by many, with his work featuring in various prominent publications. (To be paraphrased.) -->
